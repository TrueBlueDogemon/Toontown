Contributing 
============

Don't just start contributing. We talk about what we are about to do before we do it! All changes, except for emergency bug fixes, should be done in either a separate branch, or a fork -- **not** to the master or release branches. When you are ready to merge your changes, submit a _pull request_ for review.  

**Note:** Issues submitted in this repository are designed for *code-related* issues only. Issues involving starting the game will be ignored. Please view the [dependencies](https://github.com/ToontownFellowship/src/wiki/Dependencies) page in the wiki for help starting Toontown Fellowship.

Thank You
=========

Toontown Fellowship was started using Toontown Infinite's source
code. If it wasn't for the amazing developers of Toontown Rewritten,
the people behind Toontown Infinite, the Astron team, and finally Panda3d,
Toontown Fellowship wouldn't be here.  

Thank you for their courteousy and their incredible pioneering work.

We also would like to thank [SweetRatt](http://www.reddit.com/user/SweetRatt) for allowing us to use his
amazing models.

Why are we here and how would we like to be different
=====================================================

Except for what is required for maintaining security (login,
connection management, and the web),  we plan on keep the server
entirely open source.  We will be pushing our changes back into either
the TTI or TTF tree depending on if we think the changes are valuable
for the entire community or just for our use.   

If you plan on bringing up your own set of servers,  great!  We'll
happily share technology.  We want to create and be part of a larger
community.  We would not be here if it were not for the source code of
TTI and TTR leaking into the open and it would be the height of
arrogance to turn around and close our trees.

I found a bug and I want to help fix it
=======================================

If there is a bug, feel free to fix it and send us a pull request (or
report it).  We will review it and hopefully accept it into one of the
two trees. 

If you need help getting the game up on your home machine, please ask
for one of the developers on our irc and we will happy help walk you
through the steps required to bring up a test server and client on
your machine.   We can all be developers.

And instead of hacking our servers, please help us make it better
instead...
